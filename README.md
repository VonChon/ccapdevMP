# CCAPDEV Machine Project : Web Application

## Idea:
The initial idea of the application is to create an online shopping app where users are able to post products of their own and sell it.
The user could also search for products that they like and buy it. The products sold can range from popular brands and products to second-hand
products. 

## Instruction to run and view the built website:
After cloning or installing the files and extracting it, do the following:
1. Open the terminal and enter the command `npm install`.
2. After installing the packages enter `cd helpers` in the terminal.
3. Inside the helpers folder enter `node addUsers.js` and `node addProducts.js` to add data inside the database.
4. After that, enter the command `cd ..` to go back to the main folder.
5. To run the program enter `node index.js` or `nodemon index` if you have it.
6. On your preferred browser, input `http://localhost:3000/` as the url and you should see the website.
